Here's a guide for documenting the setup of role-based access control (RBAC) in your Django application:

1. Custom User Model
You have created a CustomUser model that extends Django's AbstractUser class to manage users with customized permissions.
The CustomUser model includes the following permissions through the Meta class:
can_view
can_create
can_edit
can_delete
2. Permissions Setup in models.py
In the Book model or relevant models, youâ€™ve added permissions in the Meta class:
python
Copy code
class Meta:
    permissions = [
        ("can_view", "Can view book"),
        ("can_create", "Can create book"),
        ("can_edit", "Can edit book"),
        ("can_delete", "Can delete book"),
    ]
3. Settings Configuration
In settings.py, ensure the following configurations:
Add your app to INSTALLED_APPS:
python
Copy code
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'bookshelf',
]
Set the custom user model:
python
Copy code
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'bookshelf.CustomUser'
4. Testing Permissions
Create users and assign them to different groups.
Log in as these users and test accessing various parts of the application to ensure permissions (can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete) are correctly enforced.
5. Documentation in the Code
Add comments in your code, especially where permissions are defined or enforced, to explain their usage:
python
Copy code
# Permissions for the Book model
class Book(models.Model):
    ...
    class Meta:
        # These permissions allow role-based access control
        permissions = [
            ("can_view", "Can view book"),
            ("can_create", "Can create book"),
            ("can_edit", "Can edit book"),
            ("can_delete", "Can delete book"),
        ]
